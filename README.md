# RISC

## Getting started

To play the game, you will need Java 14 and JavaFX. The server must be run with `--args="{0} {1} {2}"`, where the first argument is the server port (6066 by default), the second argument is the number of human players, and the third argument is the number of computer players. The game can be played with a total of 2-5 players.
